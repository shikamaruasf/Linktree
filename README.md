My First Project: Linktree Clone (HTML + CSS)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my very first GitHub project — a **Linktree-style webpage** built using only **HTML and CSS**.

I created this project as a starting point in my coding journey. It may be simple, but it means a lot to me as it marks **Day 1 of building in public** and learning by doing.

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a minimalist **Linktree clone** that allows users to display all their important links on a single, neat page — just like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee).  
It’s responsive (to a basic extent), clean, and completely written using plain HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no JavaScript.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Responsive layout (basic)
- ✅ Custom link buttons
- ✅ Profile image + bio section
- ✅ Pure HTML & CSS — no external libraries
- ✅ Beginner-friendly code and structure

## 📚 What I Learned

- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML

## 🙏 A Note to Fellow Beginners

If you're just starting out like me — don't wait to be perfect.  
Just build something, break things, and learn from it. This project isn’t just a page full of links, it’s a **symbol of taking the first step.**
